    Hello, u/{{author}},


    your {{kind}} has been automatically removed because your account is either too new or you don't have enough karma.


    This measure helps us protect the subreddit against spam and ban evasion. Consider building up karma and wait few days for your account to be recognized by the automoderator. In the meantime, make sure to familiarize yourself with the subreddit rules.
